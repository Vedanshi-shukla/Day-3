Asynchronous JavaScript is a programming technique that allows a program to continue responding to other events while a long-running task is in progress without blocking the main thread.

Operations like fetching data from APIs, reading files, or setting timers.

Eg: Emails or texts are examples of asynchronous communication because they 
don't have to be coordinated in time.

There are three ways to achieve this: 
1.callbacks 
2.Promises 
3.async/await.
